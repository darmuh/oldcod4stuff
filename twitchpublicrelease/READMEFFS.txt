You'll have to add

self.pers["plague_health"] = 0;

to your _mod.gsc above

self.pers["score"] = 0;
self.pers["kills"] = 0;
self.pers["deaths"] = 0;
self.pers["assists"] = 0;

for it to work with your mod.

NOTE: mp_dr_twitch still has runtime errors here and there. I never fully finished making the map unfortunately. I'm sure some of you are talented enough to fix my mistakes however.

NOTE2: ADD darmuh_mp to your mod iwd containing the rest of the mod weapons.
